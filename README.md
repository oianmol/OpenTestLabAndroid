Still in alpha stages but hey! it works!

## Overview

This project enables Android developers to execute automation test cases on self-hosted servers. It simplifies the process of executing the test suite by providing a simple configuration via a gradle plugin provided with the project.

## Features

- Run automation tests on a self-hosted server
- Plug in any Android devices on the machine and make sure ADB is enabled
- Easy setup and configuration
- Comprehensive logging and reporting (TBD)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit
- Android SDK
- [Any other required tools or libraries] (TBD)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oianmol/OpenTestLabAndroid.git
